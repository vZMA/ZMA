# ZMA Facility Engineering

### Overview

This repository contains the master copies of important ZMA Facility Engineering documents and data that need to be versioned and released in a controlled manner. This repository is private and not accessible to the general public.

The purpose of this repository is to be:
* a master copy of the files.
* an immutable archive and backup for disaster recovery purposes 
* a version management system for tracking difference between file versions
* a release management system to identify which versions of the documents are released, and when
* an issue tracking system that allows others to record facility issues that need attention
* a centralized collaboration tool that allows multiple contributors to particpate simultaneously without losing work

### Repository Structure

The repository structure is structured as follows:

- archive/ *do not edit; files as they existed upon conversion to a git repo on 2019.04.27*</li>
- docs/ *active docs used to manage the facility, including a reconstituted file history*
